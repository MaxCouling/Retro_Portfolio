I decided it was time to upgrade the typing experience. I got my hands on some **Akko Penguin Tactile Silent Switches** and installed them into my keyboard.

The goal was to get that satisfying tactile bump without the loud clack that wakes up my girlfriend and the dog. These switches are incredibly silent and feel smooth.

Check out the process and the shots:
