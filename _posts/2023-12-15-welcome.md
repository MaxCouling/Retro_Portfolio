Welcome to my new website. I decided to upgrade from the standard corporate look to something more... aesthetic.

This site functions as a central hub for:
* My CV and professional history.
* Software projects (check out my GitHub).
* Hardware projects (keyboards, Pis, and more).
* Reviews of books and movies I've consumed recently.

Stay tuned for more updates. End of line.
